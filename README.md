## Description

The PyLite Customers Project is a short simple Python Program which allows you to view, edit and delete rows from a basic database using sqllite. 
This shall also recreate the data in order to show that not only is the data easy to store, but also maintain if something went wrong.

Note: Your data will be stored locally and is overwritten after each launch of the program. The program may need to be ran twice in order to execute properly.
